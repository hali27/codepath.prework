My aap idea:
CampusSwap designed for students to swap or thrift items on campus. Whether it's clothes, textbooks, dorm decor, or electronics, , students can list items they no longer need and browse what others are offering.

Planned Features:
    List an Item: Snap a photo, write a quick description, and post it
    Browse & Filter: Search by category (clothing, books, tech, etc.) or condition
    Swap Request: Request to trade an item, or offer cash instead
    Verified Student Accounts: Sign in with student email to ensure campus-only access
    Pickup Location Suggestions: Choose a safe meetup spot on campus
    In-App Messaging: Chat securely to coordinate exchanges
